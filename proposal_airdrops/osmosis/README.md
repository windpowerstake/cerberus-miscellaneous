# Introduction
This is a proposal for the Founder of cerberus to show up and airdrop osmosis stakers, giving away an amount of their controlled tokens to lively community (as per  initial roadmap).

This is one of the three airdrops that were considered intially, and it can/needs to be followed by more measures to give away power to the community. Especially stakers searching to decentralize voting power through the osmos ecosystem.

# Proposal for the founder

This is a message to propose the following cerberus per osmo ratio. The author of this text does not controll founder accounts, therefore this is a proposal for the founder if they want to collaborate.

Proposal to give away to the community: from founder-controlled accounts.
Ratio: 40 CRBRUS per 1 OSMO
